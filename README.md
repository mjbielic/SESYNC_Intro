# SESYNC_Intro
We are part of a larger SESYNC Pursuit team synthesizing existing food-energy-water (FEW) datasets to establish and characterize typologies of FEW systems in the U.S., and then use the typologies to understand change points and subsequent drivers of change. These typologies will provide a roadmap for future research by revealing the principal FEW stresses and interactions across space and time and in response to social, economic, ecological, and other drivers.
Our goal this week with this workshop and mini-project is to practice working with our data in R and developing reproducible data processing steps using R + Git.
